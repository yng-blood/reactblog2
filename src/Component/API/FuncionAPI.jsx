        Title: "Manchurian",
        Blog: "The word \"Manchurian\" means native or inhabitant of Manchuria (around northeast China), but the dish is basically a creation of Chinese restaurants in India, and bears little resemblance to traditional Manchu cuisine or Northeastern Chinese cuisine.[4] It is said to have been invented in 1975 by Nelson Wang, a cook at the Cricket Club of India in Mumbai, when a customer asked him to create a new dish, different from what was available on the menu.[5] Wang described his invention process as starting from the basic ingredients of an Indian dish, namely chopped garlic, ginger, and green chilis, but next, instead of adding garam masala, he put in soy sauce, followed by cornstarch and the chicken itself.[6] A popular vegetarian variant replaces chicken with cauliflower,[3] and is commonly known as gobi manchurian. Other vegetarian variants include mushroom, baby corn, and veggie ball Manchurian.[citation needed]",

        Blog: "Biryani is a South Asian mixed rice dish with its origins in the Indian subcontinent. It is made with Indian spices, rice, and meat (chicken, beef, goat, pork, or fish), and sometimes, in some vegetarian versions, with vegetables such as potatoes, carrots, or green peas. Biryani is typically cooked in a special type of pot called a biryani handi, where the rice and meat are layered, and then cooked over a slow fire. \nThere are many regional variations of biryani in India, each with its unique blend of spices and cooking techniques. Some of the most popular types of biryani include Hyderabadi Biryani, Lucknowi Biryani, Calcutta Biryani, and Sindhi Biryani.",

        Blog: "Disney, home of 20th Century, is being cautious in regard to giving any projections as to The Way of Water and Titanic.The all-time list is topped by Cameron’s original Avatar ($2.92 billion), followed by the Russo brothers’ Avengers: Endgame ($2.79 billion), according to Comscore. Titanic is presently No 3. The Way of Water isn’t expected to catch up with Marvel’s Endgame or the first Avatar, released in 2009.Similar to Cameron, Disney — also home of Marvel and Lucasfilm, among other brands — dominates the upper reaches of the all-time grossing chart. Already, The Way of Water is only the sixth film in history to have crossed the $2 billion mark globally, and currently ranks No. 4 on the list of top international earners with more than $1.458 billion in ticket sales. Domestically, its earnings through Thursday were $605 million, which puts it at No. 13 on the roster of top-performing films.One fun twist: On Feb. 11, Paramount and 20th Century are rereleasing a remastered 3D version of Titanic in time for Valentine’s Day. The global reissue could whip up another $30 million to $40 million, which would increase the movie’s worldwide cume to $2.224 billion to $2.234 billion.",
